Problem 2

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

fibo = (max) -> 
  seq = [n1=1,n2=1]
  while n1+n2 < max
    seq.push(n1+n2)
    n2 += n1
    n1 = n2-n1
  return seq

console.log (x for x in fibo 4000000 when x%2==0).reduce (h,t) -> h+t
